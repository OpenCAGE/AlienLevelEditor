<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Cw2GbgO.png" width="100%">

A work-in-progress project to build a level editor for Alien: Isolation. Currently in a highly experimental state and not really fit for use! 

Supported:
 - 3D models
 - MVR entities
 - Common material types
 
Not yet supported:
 - COMMANDS entities (change an MVR's `IsThisTypeID` to 3 to pull transform data from MVR)
 - Less common material types
 - Lighting

This tool will eventually become a part of [OpenCAGE](https://github.com/MattFiler/OpenCAGE).
