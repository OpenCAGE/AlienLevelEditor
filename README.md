# Alien: Isolation Level Editor

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Cw2GbgO.png" width="100%">

A work-in-progress project to build a level editor for Alien: Isolation. Currently in a highly experimental state and not fit for use! MVR objects are currently supported, however COMMANDS objects are not (coming soon!). A range of material types have also not been implemented yet, nor FX or lighting - so maps will not look 1:1 as they do in-game.

This tool will eventually become a part of [OpenCAGE](https://github.com/MattFiler/OpenCAGE).
